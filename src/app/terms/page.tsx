            This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred

            agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may

            exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a
            court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
            You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and the
            Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
            participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a

          <p>
            The Company is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
            efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and
            to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at
            office@nexusnetwork.co.in. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a
            party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other,
            by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) to the
            Company. The Notice should be sent through an electronic mail to
            office@nexusnetwork.co.in (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i)
            describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set
            forth the specific relief sought. If the Company and you do not
            resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice
            is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration
            proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
            offer made by the Company or you will not be disclosed to the
            arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any,
            to which you or the Company is entitled.

            Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance
            with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) rules
            and procedures, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there
            is any inconsistency between any term of the SIAC Rules and any term
            of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
            Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines
            that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms
            would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator
            must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service. All
            issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating
            to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
            Agreement. Decisions by the arbitrator are solely enforceable in the
            competent courts of Singapore.

          or third-party software. This Terms of Service will be governed by the

          provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
          arbitration, as set forth above, you and the Company submit to the
          exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitration and courts located within
          Singapore. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right
          or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
          such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is
          found by a arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be
          invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator court

          in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service
          remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any
          statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
          out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must

          or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and

          business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
